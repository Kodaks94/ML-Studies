# Learning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformers

## Overview

This project is dedicated to exploring and understanding Large Language Models (LLMs), other language models, and transformer architectures. It provides a comprehensive set of Jupyter Notebooks that cover various aspects of these models, including their design, implementation, and practical applications in natural language processing (NLP).

## Project Structure

The project consists of several Jupyter Notebook files organized into folders based on specific topics. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, providing explanations, code examples, and interactive exercises to facilitate learning.

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Language Models**:
   - Overview of language models and their applications.
   - Differences between traditional models and modern LLMs.

2. **Transformers Architecture**:
   - In-depth explanation of the transformer architecture.
   - Key components: attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and feedforward layers.

3. **Pre-trained Models**:
   - Working with popular pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-2, and others.
   - Fine-tuning techniques for specific tasks.

4. **Hands-on Exercises**:
   - Practical coding exercises to build and train your own language models.
   - Implementation of text generation, summarization, and sentiment analysis tasks.

5. **Evaluation and Metrics**:
   - Methods for evaluating language models.
   - Understanding performance metrics such as perplexity and accuracy.
