   "source": "\n## 1. Conceptual Questions\n\n### 1.1 What is the difference between bias and variance?\n- **Bias** refers to the error introduced by approximating a complex problem using a simpler model. High bias indicates that the model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns of the data, leading to underfitting.\n- **Variance** measures how much the model's predictions change when using different training data. High variance indicates that the model is too complex and captures noise in the data, leading to overfitting.\n\n#### Practical Implications\n- A high-bias model, such as a linear regression model for non-linear data, will result in low accuracy on both training and test data.\n- A high-variance model, such as a deep neural network with insufficient data, will have high accuracy on the training data but low accuracy on the test data.\n\n#### Techniques to Address Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n1. Use regularization techniques like L1 and L2 penalties to reduce variance.\n2. Increase model complexity or add more features to reduce bias.\n3. Employ cross-validation techniques to identify the best model complexity.\n"

   "source": "\n### 1.2 Explain how gradient descent works.\n**Gradient Descent** is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. It does this by adjusting the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent, defined by the negative of the gradient.\n\n#### Types of Gradient Descent\n1. **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient. It is computationally expensive for large datasets but provides a stable convergence path.\n2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses one data point at a time to compute the gradient. It is computationally efficient but can have noisy updates.\n3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses a small batch of data points to compute the gradient. It strikes a balance between the stability of batch gradient descent and the efficiency of SGD.\n\n#### Gradient Descent Variants\n- **Momentum**: Helps accelerate SGD in relevant directions by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update.\n- **Adam**: Combines the advantages of both Momentum and RMSProp by maintaining an adaptive learning rate for each parameter.\n"

This exercise tests your understanding of the mathematics behind logistic regression and your ability to translate that into code.\n\n#### Mathematical Background\nThe logistic regression model is defined as:\n\n$$h(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$\n\nWhere:\n- \\(z\\) is the linear combination of input features and weights.\n- The logistic function \\(h(z)\\) maps any real-valued number into the range [0, 1].\n\nThe model is trained using the **cross-entropy loss** function, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual label.\n"
